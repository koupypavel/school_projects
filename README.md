# school_projects

A selection of the most interesting projects at VUT FIT. Including my bachelor project where I tried to tackle the basics of robotics and image processing in OpenCV. 

## Description
BP - Bachelor project. Build of small automatic vehicle with Mecanum wheels and camera. OpenCV, ROS based software capable of creating 3D map of its surroundings based on ORB-SLAM2

NAV - A project based on the Hexiwear watch and Raspberry Pi with a small touchscreen. The Hexiwear sends data (pulse, gyroscope, accelerator...) via BT to the RPI, which creates a BT/MQTT gateway to send data from the Hexiwear via wifi or Ethernet.

PDS - Raspberry Pi project that goes deeper into linux networking and usage of XDP to speed up rounting on Debian based OS - Raspbian.

SEN - ESP32 based embedded device used for ultrasonic water level measurement. Battery powered, rechargeable by a small solar cell. MQTT data broadcast to connected WI-Fi. 

SIN - Demonstration of the use of a home automation framework with ESP-based HW examples
